    <h1>Challenge: Design a Band</h1>
    <h2>Challenge Information</h2>
    
    <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>---For this challenge we used design thinking to help us come up with the band out of random material that was given to us.</li>
        <li>---We did multiple steps in order to reach this point of the project. First we came up with ideas, then we interviewed people in order to figure out what the people wanted. Then we started getting random material to cme up with the name of the artists, the name of the album, and the album cover. Then we had to come up with a story out of all of that.</li>
        <li>---First we brainstormed, then we inteview a couple of people, we then put it together. To see which was the most loved of the people. Then we got our album material and put it together, then cam A B testing to see which of the two was more loved. Then we made inprovements if necessary.</li>

    <h2>Band Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Marti was a young boy when he gt inspired to start a band. The reason as to why he was inspired was due to a band Called Linkin Park, mostly the lead volcalist Chester 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Jean Paul had grown up and grown into a locally well-known dubstep producer after having been inspired by Skrillex. One day, Jean Paul and Gunther happened to meet each other on the street and instantly started reminiscing about their history of listening to Swedish Death Pop. The two shared their current musical interests, and 12 songs later, little did they know that they would start a regional phenomenon: Gregorian Dubstep. The inspiration of the melodies draws on Guntherâ€™s time at the monastery and his fear of clowns. These inspirations, along with a chill-yet-complicated sounding band name came together to form the band's first album: Discoursing about the Trinity.
