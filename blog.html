        <p>Today was a first day in the Advanced Computer Science ellective in which we started CS50x.</p>
        <p>When we started CS50x we first watched a lecture form a Harvard Student.
        We were learning about the bianry code, it involves the 001's.
        We learned that these number had an actual meaning
        Before I just thought they were just random numbers.
        Then after learning about this in the lecture I learned that every piece of the binary code translates into numbers.
        For example 000 = 5 and 101 = 5. 
        Also some of these numbers translates into letters on the keyboards.</p>
        <p>Then for today I have to finish the lecture and write any notes I can on the lecture.
        I will also have to review some things and take a quick survey.</p>

        <p>Today was the First day of our Advanced Computer Science ellective, and I enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>We where put to make a ballon tower today.
        There where some basic rules to this but nothing to complicated.
        Just mostly like not being able to use past 25 ballons or not being able to tape it on to the table.</p>
        <p>After building the tower my "group" built a tower that was about 57 inches and the other "group" built it up to be about 17 inches, if i remember correctly.
        After the measuring of the ballon towers we had a chat with Mr. Yoho, our teacher in this class.
        He questioned us about the rules.
        He said that no where in the rules did it say that we had to work in groups, but we still did .
        He pointed this out because he wants us to start thinking out of the box when it comes to rules.
        After the conversation our teacher let both of the groups work together.
        When we all worked together we managed to build a tower that was about 86 inch tower.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed the first day of this elective.</p>
