        <p>So today I turned in my Scratch project that I worked on during the weekend, for about 3 to 4 hours.</p>
        <p>My project was just basically having to collect as much points as possible within th time span of 60 seconds.
        It wasn't difficult working on this project.
        It sure was easier than the first project I made on Scratch, the maze.
        But then again I just think it was easier because it is simpler than the Maze I had made, in a way.
        But I also did use ideas that where new to me because I did not use on my Maze but these new ideas where not so difficult to use.
        Like the variables or making a timer, they weren't difficult to use at all, and I thought it was going to be so much more difficult.</p>
        <p>I did thing my second project was going to turn out differently.
        But it some how ended up looking how it ended up looking.
        And my initial thought of how it was going to turn out did not happen at all.
        For example I was not planning on having a maze in the back ground at all, but it still some how got in there.
        I'm glad it did though because if the maze was not involved in the project it would have been so much simpler.

        <p>Today was a first day in the Advanced Computer Science ellective in which we started CS50x.</p>
        <p>When we started CS50x we first watched a lecture form a Harvard Student.
        We were learning about the bianry code, it involves the 001's.
        We learned that these number had an actual meaning
        Before I just thought they were just random numbers.
        Then after learning about this in the lecture I learned that every piece of the binary code translates into numbers.
        For example 000 = 5 and 101 = 5. 
        Also some of these numbers translates into letters on the keyboards.</p>
        <p>Then for today I have to finish the lecture and write any notes I can on the lecture.
        I will also have to review some things and take a quick survey.</p>

        <p>Today was the First day of our Advanced Computer Science ellective, and I enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>We where put to make a ballon tower today.
        There where some basic rules to this but nothing to complicated.
        Just mostly like not being able to use past 25 ballons or not being able to tape it on to the table.</p>
        <p>After building the tower my "group" built a tower that was about 57 inches and the other "group" built it up to be about 17 inches, if i remember correctly.
        After the measuring of the ballon towers we had a chat with Mr. Yoho, our teacher in this class.
        He questioned us about the rules.
        He said that no where in the rules did it say that we had to work in groups, but we still did .
        He pointed this out because he wants us to start thinking out of the box when it comes to rules.
        After the conversation our teacher let both of the groups work together.
        When we all worked together we managed to build a tower that was about 86 inch tower.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed the first day of this elective.</p>
